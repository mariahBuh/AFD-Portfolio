      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p>
        I’m a developer with a strong interest in UX/UI design, focused on creating
        clean, accessible, and user-friendly digital experiences. I spent two
        years completing a Software Development diploma and I’m currently in my
        third year of a Creative Computing degree. Alongside my studies, I worked
        for a website design company for one year and spent another year as a
        frontend developer, strengthening my ability to bridge design and
        development.
